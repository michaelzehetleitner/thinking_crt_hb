# Agent Operating Instructions

- Do **not** run `Rscript`, `targets::tar_make()`, or any R code that triggers `renv` activation yourself. Hand those commands to the user instead; sandboxed R needs system libraries outside the workspace.
- When you need to inspect data or verify logic, prefer Python utilities you can run locally. Use a `tools/` folder for small helper scripts that read raw inputs/exports (e.g., CSV snapshots) without touching `renv`.
- If you need new checks, add a Python script under `tools/` and call it from the shell; avoid R for debugging unless the user runs it.
- Keep artifacts reproducible: ensure any debug outputs (e.g., CSV drops of the raw SAV tibble) are written by early pipeline targets so they are in version control and can be re-generated by the user.
